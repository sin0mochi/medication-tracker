# Project Rules

## Environment & Deployment
- **Production Deployment**: Deployment to the production environment (e.g., Vercel/Netlify) is automatically triggered by pushing changes to the `main` branch on GitHub.
- **Workflow**: 
  1. Verify changes locally (`npm run dev`).
  2. Commit changes.
  3. Push to `origin main` to deploy.

## Communication
- **Language**: Always communicate with the user in **Japanese**.
